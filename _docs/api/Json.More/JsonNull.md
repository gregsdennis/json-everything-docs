**Namespace:** Json.More

**Inheritance:**
`JsonNull`
 ðŸ¡’ 
`object`

Provides a **System.Text.Json.Nodes.JsonNode** instance to use as null.

## Remarks

.Net has decided to unify JSON null with .Net null.  This decision has a number
of consequences.  This value is provided to get around some of these issues.
            
This class *should not be used as a property value*, but rather as a signal to indicate
that null was explicitly passed rather than a property missing.
