# [2.0.1](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/316) {#release-schemadata-2.0.1}

Keywords that support null values need to be registered as such so that they can be handled properly.  Examples supports null values, but the registration of the keyword didn't include the null-value regisration.  This fix includes the null-value registration.
